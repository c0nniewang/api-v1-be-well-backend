CognitiveDistortion.create(title: "Over generalization", description: "You see a single negative event, such as a romantic rejection or a career reversal, as a never-ending pattern of defeat by using words such as “always” or “never” when you think about it.")

CognitiveDistortion.create(title: "Discounting the Positive", description: "You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count.\" If you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn’t good enough or that anyone could have done as well. Discounting the positive takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded.")

CognitiveDistortion.create(title: "Should Statements", description: "You tell yourself that things should be the way you hoped or expected them to be. \“Musts,\” \“oughts\” and \“have to's\” are similar offenders. \“Should statements\” that are directed against yourself lead to guilt and frustration. Should statements that are directed against other people or the world in general lead to anger and frustration.")
CognitiveDistortion.create(title: "Labeling", description: "Labeling is an extreme form of all-or-nothing thinking. Instead of saying, \“I made a mistake,\” you attach a negative label to yourself. You may also label others. Then you feel that the problem is with that person’s \“character\” or \“essence\” instead of with their thinking or behavior.")
CognitiveDistortion.create(title: "Personalization and Blame", description: "Personalization occurs when you hold yourself personally responsible for an event that isn’t entirely under your control. Personalization leads to guilt, shame, and feelings of inadequacy. Some people do the opposite. They blame other people or their circumstances for their problems, and they overlook ways that they might be contributing to the problem.")
